# Heart Failure Prediction System

## Overview

The **Heart Failure Prediction System** is a machine learning-based tool designed to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients using clinical data. By analyzing key health indicators, this system assists healthcare providers in identifying patients at higher risk of heart failure, enabling earlier intervention and personalized treatment plans. The model uses a combination of vital signs, medical history, and lab results to make accurate predictions, improving patient outcomes and optimizing resource allocation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses data to handle missing values, outliers, and standardize formats for accurate model predictions.
- **Heart Failure Prediction**: Predicts the risk of heart failure using a trained machine learning model, with high accuracy and precision.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifies critical health factors contributing to heart failure risk, offering insights into patient health trends.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive interface for healthcare providers to input patient data and review prediction results.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides charts and graphs for visual insights into prediction results and patient health trends over time.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a heart failure dataset containing the following key features:
- **Age**: Patientâ€™s age
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic and systolic blood pressure readings
- **Cholesterol Levels**: Blood cholesterol level
- **Heart Rate**: Resting heart rate
- **Medical History**: Includes diabetes, smoking status, previous heart conditions, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
.

### Usage
1. Load the patient dataset or enter patient data manually.
2. Run predictions to assess heart failure risk.
3. Review model results and insights.

## Model Performance

The prediction model achieves a high accuracy, with metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score indicating reliable performance in real-world scenarios.
